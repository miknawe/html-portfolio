<h1>The Best Movies According to Ewan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cars 1</h3>
<p>This was a great fuckin movie. The simple but great plot was amazing.</p>
<h3>Cars 2</h3>
<p>The idea of a James Bond-esque storyline... for fuckin cars was quite original and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<h3>E.T (just joking its Cars 3)</h3>
<p>To be honest this one was pretty average but I just like to imagine in my head that it was phenomenal just because I love the franchise.</p>
